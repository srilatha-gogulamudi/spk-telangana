                <p class="text-center">Since ages, religion, philosophy and science have been trying to explain about creator, creation, God and Soul with umpteen theories. However clarity and completeness are not to be found in any of these.
                     Religions do not agree with one another while Science has not been consistent with new theories being proposed with the advancement of research.</p>
                <p class="text-center">Here is a saint, the scientific saint, explaining and elucidating the long standing chaos about the origin of universe, formation of life, human mind, atma,
                     paramatma etc for the benefit of human – not based on age old scriptures and complex theories but by His Divine Wisdom, in a way that is comprehensible by human reasoning.</p>

                        Sri Sri Sri Guru Viswa Sphoorthi – The Scientific Saint, is an embodiment of simplicity. It would be quite unbelievable, at the first glance, that He who is leading such a ‘down-to-earth’ life in its truest sense is the genitor of the magnanimous super-human grandeur that is experienced through multi-dimensional 
                        depth in His writings and the mystic yet practical spiritual performance through 'Mediums'.
